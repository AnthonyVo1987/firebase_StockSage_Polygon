## **5. Features - v1.2.9**

### **5.1. Stock Analysis Core**
*   **Ticker Input:** Users can input a stock ticker symbol. Defaults to "NVDA" if left blank. Input validation is performed.
*   **API Data Source Selection:** Dropdown to select available API data sources.
    *   Polygon.io API (Default & Current): Fetches market status, ticker snapshot (current day & previous day data), and selected Technical Analysis (TA) indicators (RSI, EMA, SMA, MACD).
*   **Two-Stage Analysis Process:**
    1.  **Data Fetching:** User initiates analysis, triggering `fetchStockDataAction` to retrieve data from the selected API.
    2.  **AI Analysis:** Upon successful data fetch, `performAiAnalysisAction` is automatically triggered to generate AI insights based on the fetched data.
*   **Data Display:**
    *   Presents fetched stock data (marketStatus, stockSnapshot, technicalAnalysis) in a formatted, read-only JSON `Textarea`.
*   **AI Key Takeaways:**
    *   Displays AI-generated analysis for: Stock Price Action, Trend, Volatility, Momentum, Patterns.
    *   Analysis is strictly derived from the provided API JSON data.
    *   Each takeaway label is color-coded based on AI-determined sentiment (bullish: green, bearish: red, neutral: default text color).
*   **Data Export/Copy:** Buttons to download or copy:
    *   Stock Data (JSON, Text, CSV)
    *   AI Key Takeaways (JSON, Text, CSV)
    *   All Page Data (Combined report in JSON, Text, CSV)

### **5.2. AI Chatbot**
*   **Contextual Chat:** The chatbot utilizes currently displayed stock JSON data and AI analysis summary (if available and valid) in its responses if relevant to the user's query.
*   **No Web Search Tools:** The chatbot relies solely on its general knowledge and explicitly provided context. It does **not** use web search tools (e.g., `webSearchTool` or `googleSearchRetrieval`).
*   **Markdown & Emoji Responses:** AI responses are formatted using `react-markdown` (with `remark-gfm`) and include relevant emojis.
*   **Example Prompts:** Provides users with quick-start prompt buttons defined in `src/ai/schemas/chat-prompts.ts`.
*   **Scope Adherence:** The chatbot is instructed to primarily answer questions related to stocks, options, ETFs, market sentiment, investing, trading, finances, and the economy. If context is provided, responses must be strictly limited to that context.
*   **Chat History:** Maintains conversation history for the current session.
*   **Export/Copy Chat:** Buttons to copy or export the latest AI response.

### **5.3. User Interface & Experience**
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS.

### **6.3. Detailed Code & Data Flows**

#### **6.3.1. Stock Analysis (Two-Stage: `fetchStockDataAction` then `performAiAnalysisAction`)**

1.  **Client Interaction (`StockAnalysisPage.tsx` within `StockAnalysisProvider`):**
    *   User inputs Ticker, selects API Data Source (e.g., "polygon-api"). Clicks "Analyze Stock".
    *   `StockAnalysisProvider` logs `[CLIENT_REQUEST]` for `fetchStockDataAction`.
    *   `submitFetchStockDataForm` invokes `fetchStockDataAction` server action (`src/actions/analyze-stock-server-action.ts`). `fetchStockDataPending` becomes true. `analysisStatus` becomes `data_fetching`.

2.  **Server Action (`fetchStockDataAction.ts`):**
    *   Receives `formData`. Validates inputs (ticker, dataSource).
    *   Calls `fetchStockDataFromSource(ticker, dataSource)` from `src/services/data-sources/index.ts`.
    *   `fetchStockDataFromSource` (Router): Routes to `PolygonAdapter.getFullStockData(ticker)`.
        *   `PolygonAdapter` makes API calls to Polygon.io (Market Status, Snapshot, TA Indicators). Returns structured `StockDataJson`.
    *   `fetchStockDataAction` receives `AdapterOutput`. Validates data, stringifies `stockDataJson`.
    *   Returns `StockDataFetchState` with `stockJson`, `fetchUsageReport` (if any), `timestamp`, `analysisStatus: 'data_fetched_analysis_pending'`.

3.  **Client Update & AI Trigger (`StockAnalysisPage.tsx` via `StockAnalysisProvider`):**
    *   `useActionState` updates `stockDataFetchState`. `fetchStockDataPending` becomes false.
    *   `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisProvider` merges `stockDataFetchState` into `combinedServerState`.
    *   `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisPageContent` logs `[CLIENT_RESPONSE]`.
    *   **Crucially**, another `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisProvider` (or `StockAnalysisPageContent` via context triggers) detects `analysisStatus: 'data_fetched_analysis_pending'` and valid `stockJson` for the current `tickerUsed`.
    *   `StockAnalysisProvider` logs `[CLIENT_REQUEST]` for `performAiAnalysisAction`.
    *   It prepares `FormData` with `stockJsonString` and `ticker`.
    *   `submitPerformAiAnalysisForm` invokes `performAiAnalysisAction` server action (`src/actions/perform-ai-analysis-action.ts`). `performAiAnalysisPending` becomes true. `analysisStatus` becomes `analyzing_data`.

4.  **Server Action (`performAiAnalysisAction.ts`):**
    *   Receives `formData` (stockJsonString, ticker). Validates.
    *   Calls `analyzeStockData({ stockData: stockJsonString })` Genkit flow (`src/ai/flows/analyze-stock-data.ts`).
    *   `analyzeStockData` returns `AnalyzeStockDataFlowOutput` (analysis + Genkit usage).
    *   Calculates `analysisUsageReport`. Validates takeaways.
    *   Returns `AiAnalysisResultState` (with `analysis`, `analysisUsageReport`, `timestamp`, `error`).

5.  **Client Final Update (`StockAnalysisPage.tsx` via `StockAnalysisProvider`):**
    *   `useActionState` updates `aiAnalysisResultState`. `performAiAnalysisPending` becomes false.
    *   `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisProvider` merges `aiAnalysisResultState` into `combinedServerState`. `analysisStatus` becomes `analysis_complete` or `error_analyzing_data`.
    *   `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisPageContent` logs `[CLIENT_RESPONSE]`.
    *   Updates `cumulativeStats`. Shows toasts.
    *   UI re-renders: Stock JSON, AI Key Takeaways update.

#### **6.3.2. Chatbot Interaction (`handleChatSubmit` Server Action)**
*   (Largely unchanged from v1.2.7, except no web search tools are passed to or expected by the `chat-flow.ts`)
*   Client prepares `formData` with user prompt, current `stockJson`, `analysisSummary`, and `chatHistory`.
*   `handleChatSubmit` server action calls `chatWithBot` Genkit flow.
*   `chatWithBot` uses system prompt and provided context, but does **not** use any tools (like `webSearchTool` or `googleSearchRetrieval`).

#### **6.3.3. Genkit `analyzeStockData` Flow (`src/ai/flows/analyze-stock-data.ts`)**
*   (Largely unchanged from v1.2.7, but prompt emphasizes using only provided data and avoiding generic market commentary.)
*   Input: `AnalyzeStockDataInput` (`stockData` as JSON string).
*   Prompt instructs AI to analyze `stockData` and provide 5 key takeaways with sentiment.
*   Output: `AnalyzeStockDataFlowOutput`.

#### **6.3.4. Genkit `chatFlow` Flow (`src/ai/flows/chat-flow.ts`)**
*   Input: `ChatInput` (`userPrompt`, `stockJson?`, `analysisSummary?`, `chatHistory?`).
*   System Prompt instructs AI on persona, scope, context utilization (strictly if provided), Markdown/emoji formatting.
*   **Tools: NONE.** (Both `webSearchTool` and `googleSearchRetrieval` are removed).
*   Output: `ChatFlowOutput`.

#### **6.3.5. Client-Side Data Export Flow & Theme Toggling Flow**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.7 PRD description)

### **6.4. Key Component Breakdown**
*   **`StockAnalysisPage` (`src/components/stock-analysis-page.tsx`):**
    *   Orchestrates the UI for the two-stage analysis.
    *   `DATA_SOURCES` constant updated to list only API sources.
    *   "Mock Data" button and related logic removed.
*   **`Chatbot` (`src/components/chatbot.tsx`):** (Largely unchanged, UI adapts to context availability).
*   **`DebugConsole` (`src/components/debug-console.tsx`):** (Unchanged).
*   **`StockAnalysisProvider` (`src/contexts/stock-analysis-context.tsx`):**
    *   Manages `stockDataFetchState` (from `fetchStockDataAction`) and `aiAnalysisResultState` (from `performAiAnalysisAction`).
    *   Exposes `combinedServerState` which merges these two for the UI.
    *   Handles the two-stage submission logic (`submitFetchStockDataForm`, `submitPerformAiAnalysisForm`).
    *   Manages `chatServerState` (from `handleChatSubmit`).

### **6.5. AI Integration (Genkit)**
*   **Initialization (`src/ai/genkit.ts`):**
    *   `genkitPluginNextjs()` is **REMOVED** due to `async_hooks` issues with Turbopack in earlier attempts. This is a key change for v1.2.9 stability.
*   **Flows (`src/ai/flows/`):**
    *   `analyze-stock-data.ts`: For AI analysis.
    *   `chat-flow.ts`: For chatbot.
    *   `fetch-stock-data.ts`: **REMOVED**. AI is not used for primary data fetching.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   `analyzeStockDataPrompt`: Updated to enforce analysis based strictly on provided JSON.
    *   `financialChatPrompt`: Updated system instructions to forbid web search and rely on provided context or general knowledge.
*   **Schemas (`src/ai/schemas/`):**
    *   `stock-fetch-schemas.ts`: Reflects API-based data structure.
    *   `web-search-schemas.ts`: **REMOVED**.
*   **Tools (`src/ai/tools/`):**
    *   `web-search-tool.ts`: **REMOVED**.
    *   Google Search Grounding (via `toolConfig`): No longer used in any flow.
*   **Model Management (`src/ai/models.ts`):** (Unchanged from v1.2.7 description, but `DEFAULT_DATA_FETCH_MODEL_ID` is unused).
*   **Cost Calculation (`src/ai/utils/cost-calculator.ts`):** (Unchanged).

### **6.6. Data Services Layer (`src/services/`)**
*   **Router (`src/services/data-sources/index.ts`):**
    *   `fetchStockDataFromSource(ticker, dataSourceId)`: No longer takes `mode` or TA config. Routes only to API adapters.
*   **Types (`src/services/data-sources/types.ts`):**
    *   `ALLOWED_DATA_SOURCE_IDS`: Updated to only include API sources (e.g., `["polygon-api"]`).
    *   `AnalysisMode`: Type removed as "mock" mode is gone.
*   **Adapters (`src/services/data-sources/adapters/`):**
    *   **`PolygonAdapter`:** Primary active adapter. Fetches market status, snapshot, and a predefined set of TA indicators.
    *   **`AISearchAdapter`:** **REMOVED**.
    *   **`MockAdapter`:** **REMOVED**.

### **6.8. Environment Variables**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.7 PRD description)

### **6.9. Known Development Challenges & High-Risk Indicators (Pain Points for AI Assistants)**

This section details significant challenges encountered during development, particularly those that led to application instability or build failures. **AI Coding Assistants MUST review these points before scoping or implementing new features or complex refactors.**

*   **Reference:** For full details, see `docs/pain_points.md`.
*   **Summary of Key Issues:**
    *   **`async_hooks` Module Resolution:** A persistent "Module not found: Can't resolve 'async_hooks'" error occurred, originating from `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node` (a dependency of Genkit). This Node.js-specific module caused build failures when Next.js (especially with Turbopack) attempted to bundle code for non-server environments (browser, Edge).
    *   **Turbopack Sensitivity:** The `async_hooks` issue was particularly problematic with the Turbopack bundler. Standard Webpack fallbacks in `next.config.ts` and Genkit plugin adjustments (`genkitPluginNextjs`) did not reliably resolve the error. Removing `genkitPluginNextjs` and simplifying `next.config.ts` (removing the webpack fallback for `async_hooks`) was part of stabilizing to v1.2.9, indicating these elements were problematic with Turbopack.
    *   **Genkit & OpenTelemetry Dependencies:** Integrating Genkit, which uses OpenTelemetry, can introduce Node.js-specific dependencies that require careful handling by the Next.js bundler, especially in edge or client contexts.

*   **High-Risk Indicators (Triggers for AI Caution):**
    1.  **Deep Dependencies on Node.js Internals:** Introducing/updating libraries (esp. for APM, tracing like OpenTelemetry) with non-obvious Node.js module dependencies (e.g., `async_hooks`, `perf_hooks`, `fs` in client/edge contexts).
    2.  **Complex Bundler Configurations (`next.config.ts`):** Requiring Webpack `resolve.fallback`, `alias`, or other advanced bundling configurations, especially for Node.js built-ins. These can be brittle with Turbopack.
    3.  **Use of Turbopack with Node.js-Heavy Dependencies:** If issues arise with module resolution of Node.js built-ins and Turbopack is used, Turbopack itself might be a factor. Consider testing with standard Webpack as a diagnostic.
    4.  **Genkit Plugin Interactions (e.g., `genkitPluginNextjs`):** Adding or modifying Genkit plugins, especially those managing global context, if they interact poorly with the bundler or other parts of the system. (v1.2.9 runs without `genkitPluginNextjs`).
    5.  **Persistent Build/Runtime Errors After "Standard" Fixes:** If common fixes (like Webpack fallbacks) don't work, suspect caching (clear `.next`), bundler-specific issues, or subtle dependency conflicts.

*   **Instruction for AI Coding Assistants:**
    *   AI Coding Assistants **MUST** cross-reference any new feature request or significant refactoring against these points and the content of `docs/pain_points.md`.
    *   If a proposed change aligns with one or more high-risk indicators, the AI **MUST** explicitly state this risk to the user as part of the scoping phase (see Section 6.10).

### **6.10. AI Coding Assistant Collaboration Process**

To ensure clarity, manage risk, and improve development efficiency, the following processes **MUST** be followed by the AI Coding Assistant when handling user requests.

#### **6.10.1. New Feature Implementation & Change Requests**

1.  **Step 1: AI Provides Scope (User Approval Required)**
    *   Upon receiving a request for a new feature or a significant code change, the AI Coding Assistant **MUST NOT** immediately implement the changes.
    *   Instead, the AI **MUST** first provide a detailed scope. This scope should include:
        *   A clear understanding of the user's request.
        *   A proposed plan of action.
        *   A list of all files to be created, modified, or deleted.
        *   A brief description of the changes to be made in each affected file.
        *   An assessment against the "Known Development Challenges & High-Risk Indicators" (Section 6.9 and `docs/pain_points.md`). If any risks are identified, they **MUST** be explicitly stated.
        *   Any clarifying questions for the user.
    *   The AI **MUST** wait for explicit user approval before proceeding.

2.  **Step 2: User Review & Approval**
    *   The user will review the scope provided by the AI.
    *   The user may:
        *   **Approve** the scope as is.
        *   **Reject** the scope and ask for a different approach.
        *   Request **modifications** or provide **clarifications** to the scope.
    *   If modifications are requested, the AI **MUST** return to Step 1 to provide an updated scope.

3.  **Step 3: AI Implements Changes**
    *   Only after receiving explicit user approval for the final scope, the AI Coding Assistant **MAY** proceed with implementing the code changes.
    *   Changes **MUST** be provided in the specified XML format for file modifications.

#### **6.10.2. Debugging & Issue Resolution**

1.  **Step 1: AI Provides Failure Analysis (User Review Required)**
    *   When presented with a bug, error, or unexpected behavior, the AI Coding Assistant **MUST NOT** immediately attempt to fix the issue.
    *   Instead, the AI **MUST** first provide a detailed failure analysis. This analysis should include:
        *   Its understanding of the reported problem.
        *   A hypothesis about the root cause(s) of the issue, referencing specific code, logs, or error messages if possible.
        *   An assessment against "Known Development Challenges & High-Risk Indicators" if relevant.
        *   Any diagnostic questions for the user if more information is needed.
    *   The AI **MUST** wait for the user to review this analysis.

2.  **Step 2: User Review & Scoping Request**
    *   The user will review the AI's failure analysis.
    *   The user may:
        *   **Confirm** the AI's understanding or provide corrections.
        *   **Approve** the root cause hypothesis (or an adjusted one).
        *   If the analysis seems plausible, the user will then typically **request the AI to provide a scope for fixing the issue.**

3.  **Step 3: AI Provides Fix Scope (User Approval Required)**
    *   Upon request from the user (after failure analysis review), the AI **MUST** provide a detailed scope for the proposed fix. This scope should include:
        *   The specific changes planned to address the identified root cause.
        *   A list of files to be modified.
        *   A brief description of the fix to be applied in each file.
    *   The AI **MUST** wait for explicit user approval of this fix scope.

4.  **Step 4: AI Implements Fix**
    *   Only after receiving explicit user approval for the fix scope, the AI Coding Assistant **MAY** proceed with implementing the code changes for the fix.
    *   Fixes **MUST** be provided in the specified XML format.

## **7. Success Metrics (Post v1.2.9 - Potential)**
*   (Largely unchanged from v1.2.7 PRD description, focusing on engagement, feature adoption, stability)
*   **Stability:** Reduced incidence of critical runtime errors (e.g., `async_hooks` related).

## **8. Future Considerations (Beyond v1.2.9)**
*   **Revisit `genkitPluginNextjs`:** If Turbopack or Genkit/OpenTelemetry evolves, re-evaluate `genkitPluginNextjs` for potential benefits if `async_hooks` issues are confirmed resolved in the ecosystem.
*   **More API Data Sources:** Expand beyond Polygon.io.
*   Advanced Charting, User Accounts, Real-time Data, etc. (as in v1.2.7).
