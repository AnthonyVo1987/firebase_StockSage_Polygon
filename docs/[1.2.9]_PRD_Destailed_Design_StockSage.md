# **Product Requirements Document & Detailed Design: StockSage v1.2.11**

*   **Document Version:** 1.2.11
*   **Based on Commit:** #298d8962
*   **Date:** 2025-06-05
*   **Author:** Firebase Studio (AI)
*   **Status:** Baseline for understanding StockSage v1.2.11

## **1. Introduction**

StockSage is an AI-powered web application designed to provide users with stock data analysis and insights. It allows users to input a stock ticker, select an API data source (currently Polygon.io), retrieve relevant market data (including market status, quote snapshot, and technical analysis indicators), and receive AI-generated key takeaways. Users can opt for a standard analysis or an "AI Full Stock Analysis" which automatically triggers a detailed chat-based analysis covering multiple perspectives. Additionally, users can interact with an AI chatbot for more detailed analysis or general financial queries related to the provided stock context or broader market topics. The application emphasizes a user-friendly interface, clear presentation of data, API-driven data integrity, and the integration of generative AI for deeper understanding. A prominent disclaimer regarding the informational nature of AI responses is displayed in the UI. This document details the state of the application as of v1.2.11.

## **2. Goals**

*   **Provide Accessible Stock Analysis:** Enable users to quickly fetch and view stock market status, quote data, and key technical indicators from API data sources.
*   **Deliver AI-Powered Insights:** Offer AI-generated analysis (key takeaways and optional detailed chat analysis) based on fetched API data to help users understand stock data.
*   **Facilitate Interactive Exploration:** Allow users to engage in a contextual chat with an AI assistant regarding stock data and financial topics, based on its general knowledge and provided context.
*   **Ensure Data Integrity (Contextual & API-Driven):** Prioritize fetching market status from API sources to provide a temporal context for all subsequent data and analysis. All stock data is sourced from APIs.
*   **Offer User-Friendly Interface:** Present information clearly using modern UI components and design principles, including light/dark theme support, appropriate content area sizing, and clear versioning.
*   **Maintain User Awareness:** Clearly communicate that AI-generated content is for informational purposes and not financial advice via UI disclaimers.
*   **Enable Comprehensive Debugging:** Provide extensive client-side logging and a powerful debug console to facilitate rapid troubleshooting and development.
*   **Establish a Stable Foundation:** Maintain a reliable v1.2.11 platform for future enhancements.

## **3. Target Audience**

## **5. Features - v1.2.11**

### **5.1. Stock Analysis Core**
*   **Ticker Input & API Data Source Selection:** (Unchanged from v1.2.9).
*   **Two-Stage Analysis Process with Optional Third Stage:**
    1.  **Data Fetching:** User initiates analysis (standard or full), triggering `fetchStockDataAction`.
    2.  **AI Key Takeaways:** Upon successful data fetch, `performAiAnalysisAction` automatically generates key takeaways.
    3.  **Automated Full Detailed Chat Analysis (Optional):** If user selected "AI Full Stock Analysis," a "Full Detailed Analysis" chat prompt is automatically submitted to the chatbot using the fresh data and key takeaways.
*   **Data Display & AI Key Takeaways:** (Largely unchanged from v1.2.9, key takeaways UI remains).
*   **Data Export/Copy:** (Unchanged from v1.2.9).

### **5.2. AI Chatbot**
*   **Contextual Chat (No Web Search):** (Unchanged from v1.2.9).
*   **Markdown & Emoji Responses:** (Unchanged from v1.2.9).
*   **Example Prompts:**
    *   Includes existing prompts plus a new "Full Detailed Analysis (Combined)" prompt.
*   **Scope Adherence:** (Unchanged from v1.2.9). The AI system prompt no longer includes the disclaimer about not being financial advice.
*   **Chat History & Full Export/Copy:** Maintains session history. "Copy" and "Export (.md)" buttons now process the *entire* current chat conversation.
*   **Increased Chat Area Height:** Scrollable message area is taller (`h-96`).

### **5.3. User Interface & Experience**
*   **Disclaimer in UI:** Financial advice disclaimer ("⚠️ StockSage is for demonstration purposes only...") is prominently displayed at the top of the main application page and in the footer.
*   **Application Version Display:** Version (e.g., "1.2.11") is displayed in the header of the main page.
*   **Increased Content Width:** Main cards for Stock Analysis and Chatbot are wider (`max-w-5xl`).
*   (Responsive Design, ShadCN, Themes, Toasts, Font remain as in v1.2.9).

### **5.4. Developer Experience & Debugging**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.9).

## **6. Design & Architecture - v1.2.11**

### **6.1. Tech Stack**
*   (Largely unchanged from v1.2.9. Version numbers in `package.json` may reflect minor updates).

### **6.2. High-Level Overall Diagram (Textual Representation)**
*   (Similar to v1.2.9, with the main difference being the conditional auto-trigger of `handleChatSubmit` from the client after `performAiAnalysisAction` completes, if "AI Full Stock Analysis" was chosen).

### **6.3. Detailed Code & Data Flows**

#### **6.3.1. Stock Analysis (Standard vs. AI Full Stock Analysis)**

1.  **Client Interaction (`StockAnalysisPage.tsx` within `StockAnalysisProvider`):**
    *   User inputs Ticker, selects API Data Source. Clicks "Analyze Stock" OR "AI Full Stock Analysis".
    *   `onClick` handler for the button prepares `FormData`, explicitly setting `analysisType` to `'standard'` or `'fullDetail'`.
    *   `StockAnalysisProvider.submitFetchStockDataForm` is called. This sets `combinedServerState.initiateFullChatAnalysis` and `triggerFullChatAfterAnalysis` based on `analysisType`.
    *   `fetchStockDataAction` is invoked. `analysisStatus` becomes `data_fetching`.

2.  **Server Action (`fetchStockDataAction.ts`):**
    *   Receives `formData` including `analysisType`.
    *   Sets `initiateFullChatAnalysis` in its return state `StockDataFetchState` based on `analysisType`.
    *   (Rest of data fetching logic as in v1.2.9).
    *   Returns `StockDataFetchState`.

3.  **Client Update & AI Key Takeaways Trigger (`StockAnalysisProvider`):**
    *   `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisProvider` processes `stockDataFetchState`.
        *   Sets `triggerFullChatAfterAnalysis` state based on `stockDataFetchState.initiateFullChatAnalysis`.
    *   Another `useEffect` triggers `performAiAnalysisAction` if `analysisStatus: 'data_fetched_analysis_pending'` (as in v1.2.9). `analysisStatus` becomes `analyzing_data`.

4.  **Server Action (`performAiAnalysisAction.ts`):**
    *   (As in v1.2.9, generates key takeaways). Returns `AiAnalysisResultState`.

5.  **Client Update & Potential Auto-Chat Trigger (`StockAnalysisProvider`):**
    *   `useEffect` processes `aiAnalysisResultState`. `analysisStatus` becomes `analysis_complete` or `error_analyzing_data`.
    *   **Crucially, a new `useEffect` in `StockAnalysisProvider` now checks:**
        *   If `triggerFullChatAfterAnalysis` is `true`.
        *   If `combinedServerState.analysisStatus` is `'analysis_complete'` and data is valid.
        *   If `chatFormPending` is `false`.
        *   **If all true:**
            *   Retrieves the "Full Detailed Analysis" prompt text.
            *   Constructs `FormData` for chat (user prompt, stock JSON, analysis summary, chat history).
            *   Calls `submitChatForm` (which invokes `handleChatSubmit` server action).
            *   Resets `triggerFullChatAfterAnalysis` to `false`.
    *   UI re-renders: Stock JSON, AI Key Takeaways update. If auto-chat was triggered, chatbot UI will update.

#### **6.3.2. Chatbot Interaction (`handleChatSubmit` Server Action)**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.9).

#### **6.3.3. Genkit `analyzeStockData` Flow (`src/ai/flows/analyze-stock-data.ts`)**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.9).

#### **6.3.4. Genkit `chatFlow` Flow (`src/ai/flows/chat-flow.ts`)**
*   **System Prompt:** The explicit disclaimer regarding "not financial advice" has been **REMOVED**. The AI is now allowed to provide more direct financial insights, relying on the UI disclaimer.
*   (Rest of the flow, including no tools, remains as in v1.2.9).

### **6.4. Key Component Breakdown**
*   **`StockAnalysisPage` (`src/components/stock-analysis-page.tsx`):**
    *   Now includes two analysis buttons: "Analyze Stock" and "AI Full Stock Analysis".
    *   Button click handlers explicitly set `analysisType` in `FormData`.
    *   Main card width increased to `max-w-5xl`.
*   **`Chatbot` (`src/components/chatbot.tsx`):**
    *   Main card width increased to `max-w-5xl`.
    *   Scrollable message area height increased to `h-96`.
    *   "Copy" and "Export (.md)" buttons now use a helper (`formatChatHistoryForExport`) to process the entire chat history. Button labels/tooltips updated.
    *   New "Full Detailed Analysis (Combined)" example prompt button added.
*   **`StockAnalysisProvider` (`src/contexts/stock-analysis-context.tsx`):**
    *   Manages new `triggerFullChatAfterAnalysis` state.
    *   `submitFetchStockDataForm` sets this trigger based on `analysisType`.
    *   Includes logic in `useEffect` to initiate the "Full Detailed Analysis" chat if `triggerFullChatAfterAnalysis` is true and other conditions (successful key takeaways) are met.
    *   Manages `formRef` to allow child components (analysis buttons) to construct `FormData` from the main form.
*   **`src/app/page.tsx`:**
    *   Displays the financial advice disclaimer at the top of the page and in the footer.
    *   Displays the application version (e.g., "1.2.11").

### **6.5. AI Integration (Genkit)**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   `financialChatPrompt` (`src/ai/flows/chat-flow.ts`): System instructions updated to remove the self-imposed disclaimer.
*   (Other Genkit setup remains as per v1.2.9).

### **6.6. Data Services Layer (`src/services/`)**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.9).

### **6.7. Styling Approach**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.9, aside from Tailwind class changes for sizing).

### **6.8. Environment Variables**
*   (Unchanged from v1.2.9).

### **6.9. Known Development Challenges & High-Risk Indicators (Pain Points for AI Assistants)**

This section details significant challenges encountered during development, particularly those that led to application instability or build failures. **AI Coding Assistants MUST review these points before scoping or implementing new features or complex refactors.**

*   **Reference:** For full details, see `docs/pain_points.md`.
*   **Summary of Key Issues:**
    *   **`async_hooks` Module Resolution:** A persistent "Module not found: Can't resolve 'async_hooks'" error occurred, originating from `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node` (a dependency of Genkit). This Node.js-specific module caused build failures when Next.js (especially with Turbopack) attempted to bundle code for non-server environments (browser, Edge).
    *   **Turbopack Sensitivity:** The `async_hooks` issue was particularly problematic with the Turbopack bundler. Standard Webpack fallbacks in `next.config.ts` and Genkit plugin adjustments (`genkitPluginNextjs`) did not reliably resolve the error. Removing `genkitPluginNextjs` and simplifying `next.config.ts` (removing the webpack fallback for `async_hooks`) was part of stabilizing to v1.2.9, indicating these elements were problematic with Turbopack.
    *   **Genkit & OpenTelemetry Dependencies:** Integrating Genkit, which uses OpenTelemetry, can introduce Node.js-specific dependencies that require careful handling by the Next.js bundler, especially in edge or client contexts.

*   **High-Risk Indicators (Triggers for AI Caution):**
    1.  **Deep Dependencies on Node.js Internals:** Introducing/updating libraries (esp. for APM, tracing like OpenTelemetry) with non-obvious Node.js module dependencies (e.g., `async_hooks`, `perf_hooks`, `fs` in client/edge contexts).
    2.  **Complex Bundler Configurations (`next.config.ts`):** Requiring Webpack `resolve.fallback`, `alias`, or other advanced bundling configurations, especially for Node.js built-ins. These can be brittle with Turbopack.
    3.  **Use of Turbopack with Node.js-Heavy Dependencies:** If issues arise with module resolution of Node.js built-ins and Turbopack is used, Turbopack itself might be a factor. Consider testing with standard Webpack as a diagnostic.
    4.  **Genkit Plugin Interactions (e.g., `genkitPluginNextjs`):** Adding or modifying Genkit plugins, especially those managing global context, if they interact poorly with the bundler or other parts of the system. (v1.2.9 and v1.2.11 run without `genkitPluginNextjs`).
    5.  **Persistent Build/Runtime Errors After "Standard" Fixes:** If common fixes (like Webpack fallbacks) don't work, suspect caching (clear `.next`), bundler-specific issues, or subtle dependency conflicts.

*   **Instruction for AI Coding Assistants:**
    *   AI Coding Assistants **MUST** cross-reference any new feature request or significant refactoring against these points and the content of `docs/pain_points.md`.
    *   If a proposed change aligns with one or more high-risk indicators, the AI **MUST** explicitly state this risk to the user as part of the scoping phase (see Section 6.10).

### **6.10. AI Coding Assistant Collaboration Process**

To ensure clarity, manage risk, and improve development efficiency, the following processes **MUST** be followed by the AI Coding Assistant when handling user requests.

#### **6.10.1. New Feature Implementation & Change Requests**

1.  **Step 1: AI Provides Scope (User Approval Required)**
    *   Upon receiving a request for a new feature or a significant code change, the AI Coding Assistant **MUST NOT** immediately implement the changes.
    *   Instead, the AI **MUST** first provide a detailed scope. This scope should include:
        *   A clear understanding of the user's request.
        *   A proposed plan of action.
        *   A list of all files to be created, modified, or deleted.
        *   A brief description of the changes to be made in each affected file.
        *   An assessment against the "Known Development Challenges & High-Risk Indicators" (Section 6.9 and `docs/pain_points.md`). If any risks are identified, they **MUST** be explicitly stated.
        *   Any clarifying questions for the user.
    *   The AI **MUST** wait for explicit user approval before proceeding.

2.  **Step 2: User Review & Approval**
    *   The user will review the scope provided by the AI.
    *   The user may:
        *   **Approve** the scope as is.
        *   **Reject** the scope and ask for a different approach.
        *   Request **modifications** or provide **clarifications** to the scope.
    *   If modifications are requested, the AI **MUST** return to Step 1 to provide an updated scope.

3.  **Step 3: AI Implements Changes**
    *   Only after receiving explicit user approval for the final scope, the AI Coding Assistant **MAY** proceed with implementing the code changes.
    *   Changes **MUST** be provided in the specified XML format for file modifications.

#### **6.10.2. Debugging & Issue Resolution**

1.  **Step 1: AI Provides Failure Analysis (User Review Required)**
    *   When presented with a bug, error, or unexpected behavior, the AI Coding Assistant **MUST NOT** immediately attempt to fix the issue.
    *   Instead, the AI **MUST** first provide a detailed failure analysis. This analysis should include:
        *   Its understanding of the reported problem.
        *   A hypothesis about the root cause(s) of the issue, referencing specific code, logs, or error messages if possible.
        *   An assessment against "Known Development Challenges & High-Risk Indicators" if relevant.
        *   Any diagnostic questions for the user if more information is needed.
    *   The AI **MUST** wait for the user to review this analysis.

2.  **Step 2: User Review & Scoping Request**
    *   The user will review the AI's failure analysis.
    *   The user may:
        *   **Confirm** the AI's understanding or provide corrections.
        *   **Approve** the root cause hypothesis (or an adjusted one).
        *   If the analysis seems plausible, the user will then typically **request the AI to provide a scope for fixing the issue.**

3.  **Step 3: AI Provides Fix Scope (User Approval Required)**
    *   Upon request from the user (after failure analysis review), the AI **MUST** provide a detailed scope for the proposed fix. This scope should include:
        *   The specific changes planned to address the identified root cause.
        *   A list of files to be modified.
        *   A brief description of the fix to be applied in each file.
    *   The AI **MUST** wait for explicit user approval of this fix scope.

4.  **Step 4: AI Implements Fix**
    *   Only after receiving explicit user approval for the fix scope, the AI Coding Assistant **MAY** proceed with implementing the code changes for the fix.
    *   Fixes **MUST** be provided in the specified XML format.

## **7. Success Metrics (Post v1.2.11 - Potential)**
*   User adoption of the "AI Full Stock Analysis" button.
*   User feedback on the clarity and utility of the full chat export.
*   Continued application stability.

## **8. Future Considerations (Beyond v1.2.11)**
*   **Revisit `genkitPluginNextjs`:** If Turbopack or Genkit/OpenTelemetry evolves, re-evaluate `genkitPluginNextjs` for potential benefits if `async_hooks` issues are confirmed resolved in the ecosystem.
*   **More API Data Sources:** Expand beyond Polygon.io.
*   Advanced Charting, User Accounts, Real-time Data, etc. (as in v1.2.7).
