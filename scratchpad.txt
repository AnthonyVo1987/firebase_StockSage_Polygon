OK let's scope out some more enhancemnts to the debug console to allow filetering:
###
Debug Console changes:
1. Add button for TXT file format Export and Copy to Clipboard
2. Add button for CSV file format Export and Copy to Clipboard
##
- Add a filter option options for the debug console to help search and filter out messages with details below
3. Add search box filter to allow user to input a search filter for keywords/strings to display in the debug console
##
4. Add ability to filter and show different types of messages, user can select multiple filters to show/hide in the filter
- Console Messages, Debug Log Trace Statements, API calls, AI Calls, Function Flow, Data Flow
- By default, debug console will show ALL
##
5. All the copy/export buttons for debug console, needs to take into account the current filtered messages, if any, at the time of the button press.
- So by default with no filter, button will copy/export all 
- With filters, copy/export button will only perform the filtered messages to match the console display
- There should also be a button to clear all filters
